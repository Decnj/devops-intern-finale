## Linux & Scripting Basics
I created a directory "scripts" with a shell script "sysinfo.sh" that prints current user, current date, disk usage. I created variables and assigned values using the commands "whoami", "date", "df-h". The output was printed using "echo" command.

## Docker Basics
I created a Dockerfile using a lightweight base image "python:3.10-alpine. The working directory was set to "/app" and I copied the "hello.py" file from my local machine to the container. I configured the container to the run the "hello.py" script on startup using the CMD command in the dockerfile. The "hello.py" script prints a line "Hello, DevOps!" when I run my container with "docker run --rm <image name>".

## CI/CD with Github Actions
I setup a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs the python "hello.py" script whenever i push code to the main branch on my remote repo on github. I equally attached a live status  badge  that reflects the success or failure of each run.

## Job Deployment with Nomad
I wrote a configuration file "hello.nomad" for a Nomad job "hello-devops". It sets up a Docker container using an image built locally and pushed to Docker Hub. The job operates within a group called "hello-group", it exposes port 5000 for HTTP traffic and executes a Python script on container startup. The task named "hello-task" is allocated minimal resources i.e. 100 MHz of CPU and 128 MB of memory. Before deployment of the job, start the Nomad agent in development mode "nomad agent -dev > ./nomad.log 2>&1 &". Once the agent is running, the job can be deployed using "nomad job run hello.nomad".

## Monitoring with Grafana Loki
I started Loki locally using Docker with the follwing command, mounting my log directory from my host machine:
"docker run -d --name=loki -p 3100:3100 -v "$(pwd)/loki-config.yaml:/etc/loki/loki-config.yaml" grafana/loki:2.9.4 -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml"
To view the logs, I configured Grafana to connect to Loki at: "http://host.docker.internal:3100" and used Explore tab to query: "{job="nomad"}
This setup forwards logs from the mounted "/nomad/nomad.log" file to Loki and makes them visible in
Grafana.
